# Portfolio

My dream is to become a developer. To achieve this goal, I created an account at Codecademy.
This project is a part of my journey towards my new career and I'm learning so much about coding.

To make this portfolio I had to challenge myself and really practice on making many different media queries for a very responsiv page.

## Project Description
This project was about making a portfolio. My personal goal was a serious portfolio that I might include in future job applications.\
I will update this portfolio and the projects in it and just present the two projects that I am most pleased with.

## Programming language
For this project I've used HTML, CSS and very little, basic JavaScript so far. I want to add more JS in the future when I learn more.\
So far I've noticed that CSS can do very much that also JS can do. I'm very exited to learn more about different code.

## Contact
Please contact me if you have any suggestions for improvements to my portfolio.
